# HTTP Command Service

We sometimes want to trigger device actions from the cloud; that is, from the Azure IoT Hub to EdgeX. The EdgeX Core Command Service provides a comprehensive set of APIs to achieve this. However, in some cases, you might prefer not to expose all APIs and therefore require a finer-grained control over the APIs to be exposed. For example, you might want to control the commands on specific devices that can receive commands from outside of EdgeX, or to allow only certain values for a specific command.  HTTP Command Service provides a sample implementations to achieve such control.
